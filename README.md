# Phyton-Scripts
# -These two scripts help with the automated analysis with AMDIS-
"Medium Auswertung" creates an EXCEL File with retention time and retention indices copied from the Report.tsv of AMDIS of the compounds found in the used media.

"CLSA Auswertung" does the same and also copies the data from the blank to the EXCEL File and compares the compunds via conditional formatting.

To use these scripts change the directory of path_script to your desired destination. Also you need a Report.tsv generated from AMDIS.
